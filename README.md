Qfish Analysis for module assessment component. I have utilised the data set online and chosen to download the commercial long line fishing history in which I then cleaned the data withing excel, before exporting as .csv for use in R. A little further tidying within R using tidyr and then utilising ggplot for making a basic time series bar plot for tonnes per year.
